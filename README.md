# CORECHAT
Write a program for multiple people to exchange chat messages with each other

Things which are expected
    - Python programming: Using Object oriented concepts wherever possible
    - Some basic documentation for Requirements (using use-cases)
    - Basic Design Document
    - Web server and client implementation using REST API
    - Works on a single machine
    - Text Interface
    - Every user can sign-up, login and logout, list existing people and see his/her messages as well as send new messages

Non-requirements
    - GUI Interface
    - Elaborate password saving techniques arenâ€™t required. Simply storing them in a file is good enough

Additional project extensions depending on learning interest
    - Can consider storing in DB instead of file
    - https
    - Group messages
    - Test-cases (pytest?)

Learning Objectives
    - Documentation (requirement, design document, test cases)
    - Web Server basics : HTTP, Port, connection, etc.
- REST APIs
